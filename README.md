# Gender-Age-Detection-Using-OpenCV


Faces have become an important subject of study in psychology for this reason. Gender detection can provide a wealth of information to firms' recruitment teams, for example. Verification of ID cards, such as voter ID cards, which are used by millions of people to vote in elections, and so on. Finding ineligible or fraudulent individuals is made easier with human facial image analysis. The focus of this project is developing a detection system that can accurately detect the age and gender based on its features, in order to uses in many organizations.
